I've got both the experience and target audience rapport that you're looking for. I've built two corporate training programs 
from scratch and developed the kind of interactive video programs that you're looking to create. When employees fill out feedback
 forms, they speak highly of my professionalism and clarity that they've encountered. Hereâ€™s a quick example. A close friend of
  mine on your marketing team says that this company is a great cultural fit given my background and values. I have an insatiable
   level of curiosity and tend to do lots of research on any topic that I'm less than an expert in. And I know your values include
    constant learning. That really resonates with my passion. I'm just eager to become part of a fast-growing, mission-oriented 
    organization like yours. Why this answer worked well:He spoke about his core strengths in a way that related to the job
