In Landmark is they for our peoject
When you deploy your application nowadays there some keys concepts that you need to keep in mind
  - continuous configuration
  - continuous development
  - continuous integration
  - continuous testing
  - continuous delivery
  - continuous deployment
  - continuous security
  - continuous monitoring

To accomplish these tasks abose you need infrastructure which can on-prem or cloud based.
We sit in meeting to talk about the kind of infrastructure me need to setup for the project.
 1- IDE = vscode, cloud9, eclipse, intelligent
 2- platform to use can be linux, windows
 3- workstation configuration = macos, windows, Sandbox, jumpserver, we configure Dev, UAT, Prod environment
                                [git, aws, maven, sonarqube, nexus, jenkins, Tomcat, proxies, lb, k8s]
                                git helps for versioning and for data intergrity
                                as a devops eng i make sure that developper never commit in the master branch

      we are using ansible to configure differents infrastructure:
         - jenkins master and slave
         - tomcat and jboss (appservers)
      NB: we can also use script for configuration but ansible is powerfull betocause it can automate the pprocess 
         in multiple host at the time.
         In ansible we are using module to configure
      we are using Terraform to create the infrastructure:
       we use variables, modules, workspaces to provision resources in multiple environment

In all the process, security is our priority
To access our servers in the private subnet(jenkins, maven...) we configure bastion host or jumpserver. we configure 
proxies,LB ,webservers. noted that the jumbserver has it security group so if Jenkins want to perform a tasks, 
since it has only private ip  it can not normally run build so to access him we need to ssh in to the jumpserver 
( port 22 need to be open ) in which we will allow traffic from authenticated users ip@ only. from the jumperserver
 he ssh into the appserver(port 8080 need to be open) in the private subnet.

for server in private subnet to be access via  internet by end-user need  proxies server, ELB, Webserver ( port 80/443 need 
to be open). 
Appserver can only receive traffic coming from the webServers/LB/ELB

we can also use VPN to create a trustee connection with private subnet.
 to establish private network between 2 vpc we can use vpc peering

for security we configure NACL at the subnet level and SG at the instance level.
 in NACL we configure rules to allow traffic allow to go in our subnet and check what traffic is going out.
 
 To patch our servers in the private subnet, we can use ansible server configure in the public subnet, and with 
  the help of copy module it will ssh into server in the private subnet and paste the file use for patches.

How do you measure your performance as a devops:
how much time it take to test, maintain, deploy
how many deployement are you doing is an indicator of performance
how many failure do you have
what is the ratio b/w success build and fail
implementing latest technologies in development process

Jenkins is our main automation tool. we integrated other tool as  plugin to make him more efficient
