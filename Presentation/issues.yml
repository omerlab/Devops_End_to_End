Case1:
You are running a website on 10 EC2 instances fronted by an Elastic Load Balancer. 
Your users are complaining about the fact that the website always asks them to re-authenticate 
when they are moving between website pages. You are puzzled because it's working just fine 
on your machine and in the Dev environment with 1 EC2 instance. What could be the reason?
   
   Answer: ELB Sticky Session feature ensures traffic for the same client is always redirected 
           to the same target (e.g., EC2 instance). This helps that the client does not lose his session data.


Case2: 
You are using an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to your website hosted on EC2 instances. 
It turns out that your website only sees traffic coming from private IPv4 addresses which are in fact your 
Application Load Balancer's IP addresses. What should you do to get the IP address of clients connected to 
your website?
   
     Answer: When using an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to your EC2 instances, 
             the IP address you'll receive requests from will be the ALB's private IP addresses.
              To get the client's IP address, ALB adds an additional header called "X-Forwarded-For" 
              contains the client's IP address.


Case3:
You hosted an application on a set of EC2 instances fronted by an Elastic Load Balancer. A week later, 
users begin complaining that sometimes the application just doesn't work. You investigate the issue and 
found that some EC2 instances crash from time to time. What should you do to protect users from connecting 
to the EC2 instances that are crashing?

    Answer: When you enable ELB Health Checks, your ELB won't send traffic to unhealthy (crashed) EC2 instances.

Case4:
you are required to design an architecture for a high-performance, low-latency application that will receive
 millions of requests per second. Which type of Elastic Load Balancer should you choose?

     Answer: Network Load Balancer provides the highest performance and lowest latency if your application needs 
     

Case5:
You have a Network Load Balancer that distributes traffic across a set of EC2 instances in us-east-1.
 You have 2 EC2 instances in us-east-1b AZ and 5 EC2 instances in us-east-1e AZ. You have noticed that 
 the CPU utilization is higher in the EC2 instances in us-east-1b AZ. After more investigation,
  you noticed that the traffic is equally distributed across the two AZs. How would you solve this problem?

    Answer: When Cross-Zone Load Balancing is enabled, ELB distributes traffic evenly across all 
            registered EC2 instances in all AZs.

Case6:
You have an Application Load Balancer that is configured to redirect traffic to 3 Target Groups based 
 on the following hostnames, users.example.com, api.external.example.com, and checkout.example.com. 
 You would like to configure HTTPS for each of these hostnames. How do you configure the ALB to make this work?

    Answer: Server Name Indication (SNI) allows you to expose multiple HTTPS applications each with its 
             own SSL certificate on the same listener. Read more here
