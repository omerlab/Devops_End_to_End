I have experience in Git and Github. we use git as versionning tool and to track code development.
 we use github as our source code repository since we have a team distributed in different location.
 As a DevOps Engineer i am resposible to setup developers environment, make sure that Organisation, repositories, teams,
 are created, make sure that proper member are asssigned to the right team and have the least priviledge.
 I create Branch for dev, qat and prod environment and i set all best practices that need to be follow by the team.
 i make sure that we use pull request before merging code from one branch to another
 i make sure that developers apply best practices

Git : allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files. And it helps 
      the team cope with the confusion that tends to happen when multiple people are editing 
      the same files.
      I spend a fair amount of time on Git to manage our version control. We also use Git to collaborate
       with other developers to track bug fixes, build new features, refactor codes, and many more things.
