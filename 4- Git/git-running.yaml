Coding 
=======
  codes are generally written by Developers 
  Developers write codes in languages like:
    java, javascript, python, nodeJS, PHP, C++, C, REACT.js, .net 

Tesla --- AWARD a $40b 10 YEAR contract to 
          Landmark Software Solution (LSS)    
LSS:
  Developers start coding 
  Programmers 
  Software Engineers 

Versions and Versioning i important for long or extended contract. 
  python:  
    version1 = print('Tesla your best car partners') [1-4 ] 
    
    version3 = print('Tesla the best car partners') 
ROLL-BACK:
    version4 = print('Tesla your best car partners')
               print('Tesla the leader of electric cars')
  bash_shell: echo 'Tesla your best car partners'

   mkdir tesla 
   touch Tesla/app.py    

Version Control systems:
  - Local [using your own computer/system]
       Developers write and save codes in their local-Computers 
  - Centralised
  - Distributed

Git and GitHub
==============
GIT: DVCs 
  Distributed Version Control system 
  - Git manage data as snapshots.
  - It takes a picture of what all your files look like 
     at that moment and stores 
    a reference to that snapshot.
  Benefits: Nearly every operation is local
            git has data intergrity
            Git generally only adds data

version1 = print('Tesla your best car partners')
version2 
version11
  ROLL-BACK from:
    a new version to an old version [v9 to v8]

other DVCs:
SVN --> Sub Version
CVS --> Concurrent Version system
TFS --> Team Foundation Server
Git --> 90% plus of companies are using GIT   


Git --> Distributed Version Control systems. DVCS
      Source Code Management = SCM:
        GitHub - MS
        GitLab
        BitBucket (Stash) - A

Registration Application:
  class27 
  class28 
  class29 
  Git will track all the version of our application.

IQ: As a DevOps Engineer, what are your roles & responsilities in Git?
Answer:
  1. Ensure that Developers environments are configured and secured 
     Create an enabling environment for Developers
  2. Project Onboarding 
       Create organisations where applicable 
       Create repositories in SCM [GitHub] 
       Create teams in SCM and assign members[Developers, etc.]

Git Installations
-----------------
Pre Requisite Software Download/ Registration :
Install git in Windows   :  
  Install git bash @ https://git-scm.com/downloads

Install in RedHAT Linux servers:
    Install git in git -y 

mkdir tesla 
cd tesla 

Git Commands:
  git status 
  git init 
  git add 

development is virtually managed in:
  working-area: 
    codes are Untracked files in RED          
  staging area: codes  = 
   codes are tracked and in GREEN    
      git add .  
      git add * 
      git add fileName 
      git add app.py    
  localRepo: 
    git commit -m "first version"
git --version
   
git config --global user.name "Simon Legah"
git config --global user.email "legah2000@gmail.com"
git config --global --list
  Remote-Repo    

git init 
  git begins track and keep records[versions]
  of changes made in the codes
git status 
git add  
git commit 
git log 
   list all the commits and who committed 
git show Cid  
   show all the changes of the commits

=When we run "git commit" the code is  
  moved to the Local repository

git push  -- moves code from localRepo
             to Remote-Repo 

https://github.com/landmarkdevops28/tesla  
ta =  https://github.com/landmarkdevops28/tesla  
git remote add ta https://github.com/landmarkdevops28/tesla    
 AliasName:
   ta  https://github.com/landmarkdevops28/tesla 
  daddy ---> simon legah 

To push code to any repository [public or private]
   You need to be Authenticated and authorise

   userName: dominionsystem
   password: Password support is depricated   
   token PAT: xxxxxxxxxxxxddeerrthghj1442514553.  

   git push AliasName branchName

  This records files and dirs that shouldn.t be tracked by git  
touch .classpath .project  && mkdir node_modules  
Does this also work for any other file that we don't want git to track? YES.

IQ: How many branches are you supporting?

   TD BANK  = github

   https://github.com/myLandmark-Technology/td.git

     git remote add td https://github.com/myLandmark-Technology/td.git

  private or public 
  
  git fetch : --> It brings changes in the code to the LocalRepo
  git pull  : --> It brings changes in the code to the Working area 
  git clone : --> It brings the entire code to the working area 

    use to merge changes on the RemoteRepo with the localRepo

IQ: How many branches are you supporting in your projects?
    Branches are used to create lines of development. 
    A branch is a line development 
  We maintain a minimun of 3 branches:
        development branch  
           app.java     
        staging branch  
           app.java
        master branch  
           app.java

  git branch  = list all the branches [lines of development]
  git branch branchName  = create a new branch     
  git checkout branchName = switch branches 

git commit -a -m "dev env deployment"
git commit -a -m "master deployment"
 
  git merge dev -m "merging" 
  CONFLICT 
dev
   dc1-->dc2  
master 
   mc1---mc2  
  git merge = CONFLICT will occur 
              resolve manually [vi into the affected files ]
             

dev
   dc1-->dc2  
master 
   git diff and git merge   : When you change branch, best practice is to check the difference between branch 
                               and merge it before adding any commit to avoid conflict between branch.
   mc1---mc2 

IQ- How many environments are you supporting in your projects? :

Environment:
    development branch deploying to Development ENV 
    testing branch deploys to  Testing ENV
    testing branch deploys to  UAT(QA, BA)   ENV
    MASTER branch code are deployed to  Production
 
  Branches are used to create lines of development. 
  A branch is a line development 



    td 

  development branch 

git diff development --> shows differences :

   git merge --> merges differences

   git merge development -m "Changes Reviewed ok"

   git commit -a -m "readme ready for testing"

   git merge development -m "Ready"

   git commit -a -m "merging issues fixed"

   git push origin --all 

   git push origin master 
   git push origin stage 
   git push origin development


stage branch:
  sc1-->sc2-->sc3-->sc4 

master branch:
  we need to compare, review and merge the changes in one branch
  to another use:  
  git diff  branchName 
  git merge
     sc1-->sc2-->sc3-->sc4  = mc1  
  git rebase 
     sc1-->sc2-->sc3-->sc4

What is the difference between Git & Github:
Git is an open source Distributed Version Control System(DVCS) which records
changes made to files (codes) laying emphasis on speed, data integrity in a
distributed non-linear workflows.

Github is a hosted  repo (UI)  for git or an open source SCM tools

IQ: What is the difference b/w git commit and git rebase

GIT = DVCS 
          V1      V2
master -->mc1 -->mc2-->
                      |
                      |              v3    v4    v5 = 3
                      > development dc1-->dc2-->dc3

git merge master:# dc1-->dc2-->dc3 = dc1 (v6)
                   v1 + v2 + v6

git rebase : dc1-->dc2-->dc3

Best Branching Strategy:
    development

    stage

    master -  
        bugfix_bugName
        feature
There's no specifc strategy

ookGithub-webhook

Git Best Practices:
    Use branching strategy and pull requests
    Commit once you finish the task. 
    Avoid merge Conflicts.
    Don’t Commit Half-Done - git stash
    Test your code before commit.
    Write Good Commit Messages before committing 
    Try to use git commands rather than GUI tools.
    use ssh url and PAT over https 
    use rebase over git merge
