MAVEN 

  

Maven life cycle: 

Maven executes a Clean package goal which deletes old build 

Maven has a Default goal which validates, compiles, tests goals and creates packages which we upload 
to a remote repo like nexus. 

Maven also has Site goal used to create documents for Java classes.  

  

mvn site 

Used to create packages for Java classes  

mvn site:run 

  

  

Meaning of POM 

Project Object Model 

It is a fundamental unit of work in maven, it’s an XML file containing instructions about the project 
and configuration details used by maven to do the build

Dependencies and plug-ins helps maven do a build  

 

For maven to do a build, we need source codes, test cases and Pom.xml build script. 

Maven needs dependencies and plugins which has been defined in the project file (Pom.xml) to do a build.  

  

We configure maven to grab these dependencies in settings.xml 

  

It grabs its dependencies from maven local and central repo. But maven cannot pull directly from central 
cos central is on the Internet. So it needs plugins.  

  

We also have maven remote repo, proxy repo and group repo.  

  

Mvn package - maven searches for dependencies and plugins from local repo, however we hv configured some
 dependencies from its remote repo and maven proxy  

Port 80 is open in remote and proxy to allow access for to search for dependencies and plugins if not 
found in local repo
