What is maven?
why we use maven?
how we use maven?

maven to run need plugins and dependencies. those are find in : 
    - the local repo .m2/repo
    - remote server
    - proxy server
    - central repo


  In my recent project i was task to configure maven remote, proxy repo for our maven server
   to be able to retrieve dependencies and plugins from them before accessing internet to access central repo.
   i configure maven to retrieve some dependencies from proxy and others from remote.
   
   In this scenario we don't want our build server to access internet to get plugins, it will go through
     the local--remote--proxy--central


To avoid some mistake from Jr Eng:
   - do proper onboarding 
   - restrict who can run maven command and create packages
