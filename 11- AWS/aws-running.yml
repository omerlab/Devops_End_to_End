  1. Where can Jenkins be installed -- Linux/WINDOWS/Solaris

What is your experience in Open source technologies???
  Linux   === 
    We can develop, build, test, monitore, secure, 
    backup and deploy applications
      development
        CODING === IDEs [vscode, Eclipse], [Pycharm, ]
        versioning  === [git/github], [gitlab, bitBucket] 
      Testing === [Selenium,] 

  WINDOWS === 
    We can build, test, monitore, secure, backup and deployment applications

Open source OS:
1.  Linux -- Distributions 
      Redhat -- Redhat (8,6,7)
      CentOS -- 
      UBUNTU
      Alpine 
      amazon LINUX 2/1

  Managing Linux OS: 
  Run levels ---- : differents option that you have to run tasks in linux

   Run level 5 : Multi user --> laptop run at this level
      Graphical User Interface (GUI) - 
      Commands- CLI 

   Run level 3 : - Multi user (CLI)  --> muliti can be connect at the same time
       Linux Commands 
       Shell SCRIPTING 
       ec2-user / simon / landmark

   Run level 1 : - Single user (CLI) ---> only one indivual can perform tasks

What have we use to access and run tasks on our Linux servers??
   COMMANDS    = CLI   

   
What are using using to access and run tasks on your workstation?: = GUI

Dominion Systems   === 
Infrastructure types:
  1. On-prem Datacenter
    Organisation owns ,manages and maintains all infrastructures (servers, networks, storages)

on-prem Db Poses Scaling issues: 
 Year1   1000 customers =  20 servers
 Year2   2000 customers =  40 servers
 Year3   5000 customers =  100 servers
 Year4   2000 customers = 

 to manage a datecenter you need :
    - dedicated space 
    -  High bandwith/superfast internet
    - redundant power supply
    - support availability linux admins
    - capacity planning
    - higher maintainance efforts.
    - time consuming
    - leadership experience

    Business requirements:

    - High availability
    - Fault tolerant  ---> withstand failure if one or more system components go down
    - scalability  ---> add and reduce resources dynamically
    - elasticity

What to consider before choosing a region in AWS:
 
 Availability --- EC2/EKS/S3/ECS  
    us-east-1 
    af-west-1    
        High Availability:
          1. Deploy using Multi AZs   
          2. Deploy using Multi Regions     
          3. Multi-cloud -- AWS/GCP/AZURE   
          4. Multi INSTANCE  [Tomcat  or 4 Tomcat Servers ]
