My experience in tomcat is :
  i have been able to install tomcat server for application Deployment

  i have been able to configure tomcat  :
     - /opt/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml : i grant access to authorised users in tis file
     - /opt/tomcat9/conf/server.xml  : for security by changing the default port
        when changing tomcat default port i need to restart tomcat.
             - sh /opt/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh
             - sh /opt/tomcat9/bin/shutdown.sh
    -  /opt/tomcat9/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml: to access tomcat from another server because by default tomcat is 
          only available from localhost
  
  i manage tomcat from GUI and CLI
