Nexus is our Artifactory. we use it to upload our artifacts
Nexus : 
       is a repository manager. It allows you to proxy, collect, and manage your 
dependencies so that you are not constantly juggling a collection of JARs. It makes
it easy to distribute your software. Internally, you configure your build to publish 
artifacts to Nexus and they then become available to other developers. You get the benefits 
of having your own 'central', and there is no easier way to collaborate.
