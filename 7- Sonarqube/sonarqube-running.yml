 LandmarkSS is providing 10 year support to PayPal applications:
Software Quality is vital:
How to determine if Quality Software were developed to the client?? 

Various tools can be used for code quality:
  - Resharper 
  - Codacy
  - checkmarx
  - Codebeat

Features:

- It addresses not only bugs but also  coding rules, test coverage, code duplications,
   complexity, and architecture provising all the details in a dashboard.
- It gives you a snapshot of your code quality at certain moment of time as well as trends of lagging and leading quality indicators.
- It provides you with code quality metrics to hepl you take right decision
- They are code quality metrics that show your progress and whether you're getting better or worse.

It continuously analyses and measures quality of the source code.
➢ I will generate the report if any issues in html format/PDF format.
➢ It is a web-based tool which supports multiple languages (Java, C#, JS …)
➢ It will support multi OS platform (Windows. MAC, Linux…).
➢ It will support multiple databases (MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL
...)
➢ Supports multiple browsers (IE, Microsoft Edge, FF, Chrome, Safari)
➢ It will identify the below category of issues.
• Duplicated code
• Coding standards
• Unit tests
• Complex code
• Comments
• Potential Bugs
• Architecture & Design
➢ Initially it is developed only for Java projects.
➢ Today it is supporting over 20 languages.



1. Software testing:

   unit testing : UNIT TESTING is a level of software testing where individual modules/units/components of a
   software are tested. It requires detailed knowledge of the internal program design and code.
   This type of testing should cover at least 80% of the code as validated by a code coverage 
   tool such as SonarQube or Codacy
       is written and performed by developers 
       --- Maven [mvn test or mvn package/install]

   functional : 
Test automation is the use of special software to control the execution of tests and the 
comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Test automation can automate 
some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place or add 
additional testing that would
be difficult to perform manually. 
Test automation is critical for continuous delivery and continuous testing.
There are various methods of functional test automation like using Selenium framework
       
   regression testing: 
Regression testing is a type of software testing that verifies software previously developed 
and
tested still functions and performs correctly after it was modified. Such modifications may 
include
software enhancements, bug fixes, patches and configuration changes.

=========================
2. Code Quality Analysis  : 
    - make code readable
    - easy to maintain code in future
    - detects bugs at earlier stage

     In git/GitHub developers commit :  
      src Codes  -- 10,000 lines of code  
      JUnit Tests Cases -- -- 3,000 unit test cases   
      buildScript-pom.xml 
      javaProjects 

for example if the develop paypal.java application they need to commit 

 code:  echo 'Welcome to PayPal' --- Line1  
 unit test case : paypalTest.java 
                   if [welcome -e] then 
                   echo its ok

sonarqube:
  how many test cases should be there? 10, 000
  how many unit test case are written?   3,000
    code coverage = 3000/1000*100% = 30% = poor 

maven:
  mvn package   
     validation 
     compilation 
     JUnit-Testing
         [runs 3000 test cases = failed]
         [runs 3000 test cases = pass]
     packaging[jav/war/ear]
   maven only test the test cases committed by developer. it will not check the number of line of code versus the number of testcases.
   it doesn't do code quality analysis

sonarqube/Benchmarking:
comparing actual results against the benchnark/standards
1. How many unit test cases were runned?
   How many test cases should have being runned? 

2. Is our code easily readable? 
        ----> code smells 

3. Is our code portable [environment independent]?
    -- if not code smells / hard coding 

4. Are the vulnerabilities in the code ?
    ---> if they are then --- 
       password -- any 4 characters 
             1234

Benchmark/standard:
  1. code coverage = 
  2. bugs 
  3. dubli

Code Quality expectations:
  code coverage    = 90%
• Duplicated code  = 5% we can use {Functions} to achieve that.

How to change the default port number from 9000 to custom port in SonarQube server?:

Go to the conf directory and open the sonar.properties and search for 
Sonar.web.port=9000 and
Replace 9000 with 9001

As a good security practice, SonarQube Server is not advised to run sonar service as a 
root user, so create a new user called sonar and grant sudo access to manage sonarqube
services as follows
 
  - useradd sonar
  # Give the sudo access to sonar user 
   visudo
   sonar ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
#Change the owner and group permissions to /opt/sonarqube-7.8/ directory. 
 chown -R sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube-7.8/
 chmod -R 775 /opt/sonarqube-7.8/ 
 su - sonar
 cd /opt/sonarqube-7.8/bin/linux-x86-64/
 ./sonar.sh start 


Troubleshooting:

sonar service is not starting?:

a)make sure you need to change the ownership and group to /opt/sonarqube-7.6/ directory for 
sonar user.
b)make sure you are trying to start sonar service with sonar user.
c)check java is installed and version compatibility or not using java -version command. 
Unable to access SonarQube server URL in browser?
a) make sure port 9000 is opened in security group in AWS ec2 instance or firewall.
