Answer1:
From a very early age I've been a problem solver. I was that kid who would take apart anything so I could see how it worked—and
 then try to put it back together. As you can imagine, it drove my parents nuts. But even though I tortured my family at times,
  the tinkering trait has served me well in my career. After graduating from Purdue, I was recruited into a field technician job 
   and got paid to take apart broken packaging equipment. It was like living the dream. That job also made me realize I'm really 
    good with difficult customers, and that's what helped me land my current account manager role. While I love my job and have been 
     successful in it, it has moved me away from the manufacturing floor. Now, the reason I'm so interested in this position is that 
      it seems to provide a really great blend of one-on-one work with clients and hands-on problem solving. Why this answer worked well 
      :He gave a vivid image of his childhood home and told a memorable story about it.He picked two prominent required skills from the job 
      description, problem solving and customer service, and built this interesting narrative around it.He showed how his career successfully 
       evolved before he was even asked about that.


Answer2:
I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life, personal and professional. In my professional life,
 I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most. I’ve taken on many different types of projects, including 
  application development, infrastruture provionning, system maintenance and so on. No matter what I’m working on, I’m very invested. I identify anyone I can learn from, as well 
   as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process. In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually 
    have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched d--------- 
     . I found it fascinating, and it actually sparked a desire to change 
      industries — which eventually led me to my last role and even helped prepare me for the switch. Outside of reading and researching, I also love 
       to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.
