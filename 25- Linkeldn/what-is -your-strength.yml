Answer1:
What I bring to the team is a strong record in relationship building. I'm happiest when I'm engaging and strategizing about   
how we can help one another. I find that in sales, some people can be overly transactional. I think my superpower is in 
 establishing more meaningful connections. I've gotten strong feedback in the past. One client said I was the best business 
  development person he'd ever met. These types of connections have turned into big sales wins. For example, last year, I doubled 
   my client base and outperformed my peers by 40%. And it's probably relevant to share that I started in that role without any 
    contacts in the field. Today, there isn't a Fortune 100 company that doesn't know about the product I sold last. Why this answer 
     worked well:She was specific and shared real numbers.She stayed relevant. The experience and the story all came together and she supported it all with numbers. 


Answer2:
My greatest strength is strategic thinking. I am often able to quickly spot patterns and issues and create alternatives before my 
 teammates even realize there is an issue. The way this shows up in my work experience is through risk mitigation. As an example,
  I was starting a new project with a new team in an industry I had never worked in before. The team seemed to think that the project 
   was very straight-forward and that they didn’t even really need a project manager to help them. We kicked off the project by creating 
    a charter, social contract, and reviewing the risks. We got halfway through the project and realized the requirements were ambiguous 
     and we weren’t delivering what the client really wanted. I had picked up on some subtle cues that this was the case and had already  
      taken the initiative to meet with the client to clarify the requirements. I presented my findings to the team and showed three 
       alternatives to our existing plan to accommodate the updated requirements. From my team’s point of view, I was able to bring 
        solutions to the problem conversation and we didn’t lose any time with the project timeline.
        
         It was a win win! Why this answer worked well:The candidate demonstrated the ability to detect issues and opportunities early.
         The example showed a willingness to take initiative to improve clarity and process.
