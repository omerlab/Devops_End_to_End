The awk command uses a scripting language for manipulating data and creating reports. The awk programming language does not require compiling, and allows a user to employ variables, logical operators, string functions, and numeric functions. Awk lets programmers write small programs using statements using patterns of text that can be within the lines of a document, and then employ an action based on when a match is found. In essence, awk searches files to see if they contain text which matches specific parameters and then executes an action.

awk options 'selection _criteria {action }' input-file > output-file

user@host:~$ awk '{print}' file.txt
