File Commands :

These shell commands allow us to manipulate files.

ls: If you run the ls command (without any additional parameters), the program will simply list the contents of the current directory in a short form.

ls [option(s)] [file(s)]
-l a detailed list
-a displays all hidden files
 ls -lah is aliased as ll on some systems
The cp command copies a sourcefile to a targetfile.

cp [option(s)] sourcefile targetfile
-i : The -i flag prompts for confirmation before an existing file is overwritten
-r : The -r flag copies subdirectories recursively 
The mv command copies from a sourcefile to a target file, then removes the source file.

mv [option(s)] sourcefile targetfile
-b : The -b flag creates a backup copy of the source file prior to moving it
-i : The -i flag waits for confirmation before the existing target file is overwritten
The rm command removes the files from the file system. Directories themselves are not removed by rm unless the -r option is used.

rm [option(s)] file(s)
-r Removes any existing subdirectories
-i Waits for confirmation before deleting each file
-rf deletes with confirmation
(use with EXTREME CAUTION as this command removes the file or directory forever.)
As you can below, we created several directories and then using rm via the xargs command, we can remove those same directories.

root@host:~#
The ln command creates a link from the source file to the target file, using a different name. This link will point directly to the source file on the same file system. However, if ln uses the -s option, it creates a symbolic link that points to the directory location where the source file is located, which enables linking across file systems.

ln [option(s)] sourcefile targetfile
The -s flag creates a symbolic link.
Directory Commands
Using the cd command alone without any parameters changes directories to the user's home directory.

cd [options(s)] [directory]
The mkdir command creates a new directory. The same command can also create multiple directories.

mkdir [option(s)] directoryname
mkdir {test1,test2,test3}
The rmdir command deletes a specific directory, assuming it is empty.

rmdir [option(s)] directoryname
The chown command transfers ownership of a file to the user, with the specified username.

chown [option(s)] username.group file(s)
Using the -R flag changes file and directory ownership in all subdirectories.

The chgrp command modifies or assigns the group ownership of a file or folder.

chgrp [option(s)] groupname file(s)
Ownership and Permissions
The chmod command changes the permissions access.

chmod [options] mode file(s) 
This parameter has three parts: group, access, and access type. The group option accepts the following characters:

u = user
g = group
w = world
Access is allowed by using the '+' symbol and denied by the '-' symbol.

The following options control the access type itself:

r = read
w = write
x = execute 
s = Set uid bit - the program or application is loaded as if the owner of the file started it.
